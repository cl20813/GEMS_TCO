Tested t-distributed nugget

        # Generate t-distributed noise values
        df = out.shape[0] # degrees of freedom for the t-distribution
        t_noise = t.rvs(df, size=out.shape[0]) * nugget
        
        # Add the t-distributed noise term to the diagonal for numerical stability
        out += np.diag( np.abs(t_noise))

By looking at the likelihood, it didn't seem to be helpful.
